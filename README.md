**DESCRIPTION**

The project titled “Automated Report Generation” involves designing and developing a Python script that reads data from a file (such as a CSV), analyzes it, and produces a structured, formatted PDF report using libraries such as FPDF or ReportLab. This task reflects a real-world automation scenario, where daily or periodic reporting needs to be completed efficiently without manual intervention. The objective is to demonstrate the ability to handle data programmatically and present insights in a user-friendly and professional format.

The first component of the task is data ingestion. A CSV (Comma Separated Values) file is used as the input source for this project. The data could represent anything — for example, student scores, sales numbers, attendance logs, or survey responses. The Python script utilizes the pandas library to load this data and perform basic statistical analysis, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and minimum or maximum values. This analysis is stored in a summarized form, which serves as the core content of the report.

After the data is processed, the next step is report formatting and generation. For this, the FPDF library is used to create a PDF document. The report includes a title, generation date and time, page numbers, and a detailed section that presents the summary statistics derived from the data. The layout is made clean and professional to ensure clarity and readability. Optional enhancements, such as adding charts or logos, can be integrated to make the report visually richer.

This script offers flexibility — it can be modified to read different types of data, generate reports on a scheduled basis (using libraries like schedule or system tools like cron), and customize the report format. It is especially useful in business environments, educational institutions, or research labs where repetitive data reporting is common. Automating the report generation process saves time, reduces human error, and ensures consistency in reporting.

The outcome of this project includes two key deliverables: a Python script (report_generator.py) that automates the entire pipeline from data to report, and a sample PDF report (sample_report.pdf) generated using test data. Together, these showcase the functionality and completeness of the solution.

From a learning perspective, this project enhances understanding of:

File handling and data analysis using pandas

Report formatting with FPDF (or ReportLab)

Modular coding and clean scripting practices

Automation of manual data tasks

The skills acquired through this task are directly applicable in data analytics, automation engineering, and business intelligence roles. On successful completion of this task and submission of the deliverables, a completion certificate will be awarded, recognizing the intern's ability to build real-world solutions with Python.

In conclusion, this automated report generation task is a practical and impactful assignment that bridges programming with real-world data analysis and presentation. It not only strengthens Python development skills but also builds a portfolio-worthy project that demonstrates problem-solving, creativity, and efficiency.
